# We are going to create a hangman like program. Make sure you test every step properly before you move on to the next one.

# Make a list to store 10 words. - Done
# Pick a random word from the list and save it somewhere - Done
# Print the length of the random word - Done
# Give players 5 chances to guess the letters in the word while giving them appropriate success and failure messages. - Done
# On the 6th attempt, ask them to guess the whole word. Compare the randomly selected word with the userâ€™s guess, if it is correct, the user wins. -

# Hint: you can use if i in word - to check if a particular letter is in the word.
